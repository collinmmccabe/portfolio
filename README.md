A summary of my work in various languages which don't quite fit into normal repos on their own

## Description
This folder contains a sampling of my work with R and MySQL, both of which I've 
been working with for the past 9 years, although my experience with R far 
exceeds that with MySQL, as I've used R on a nearly daily basis throughout this 
time period for my research and independent projects.

## Social Network Analysis Teaching
In the folder [Social Network Analysis Teaching](/Social%20Network%20Analysis%20Teaching) are two 
problem sets, which I wrote and used for teaching R and social network analysis at Harvard 
University. These folders are most easily understood by starting at the pdf 
document in the "Directions" folders of each problem set and then following 
along with the directions contained within the document.

## Github
In the [github.md](github.md) file, you will find a link to my github profile, which 
is still a work in progress, but it contains a few particular highlights:
1. An [R package](https://github.com/collinmmccabe/enss) that I've recently been developing to 
make public a novel method developed by myself and a collaborator at Duke University
2. [R code](https://github.com/collinmmccabe/networkmetrics_groupsize) from an article I wrote 
with some colleagues, which walks the user through replicating the phylogenetic comparisons of 
network metrics contained in the article
3. [MATLAB code](https://github.com/collinmmccabe/coordinated_antisocial_punishment) for replicating the 
game theoretic simulations of coordinated antisocial punishment from another article I wrote

## PHP & MySQL Projects
In the [PHP_MySQL_Projects.md](PHP_MySQL_Projects.md) file, you will find 2 webpages which I led 
development on for various projects. Although both pages are only protoypes, 
I believe they properly display my ability in developing and deploying 
interactive, useful databases for a variety of purposes.

## CV
