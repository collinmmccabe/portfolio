This folder contains a sampling of my work with R and MySQL, both of which I've 
been working with for the past 8 years, although my experience with R far 
exceeds that with MySQL, as I've used R on a nearly daily basis throughout this 
time period for my research and independent projects.

- In the folder "Social Network Analysis Teaching," are two problem sets which
I wrote and used for teaching R and social network analysis at Harvard 
University. These folders are most easily understood by starting at the pdf 
document in the "Directions" folders of each problem set and then following 
along with the directions contained within the document.

- In the "Github.txt" file, you will find a link to my github profile, which 
is still a work in progress, but it contains one particular highlight, that 
being an R package that I've recently been developing to make public a novel 
method developed by myself and a collaborator at Duke University.

- In the "PHP_MySQL_Projects.txt" file, you will find 2 webpages which I led 
development on for various projects. Although both pages are only protoypes, 
I believe they properly display my ability in developing and deploying 
interactive, useful databases for a variety of purposes.
